QATAKI
======

Qataki is a CLI Identi.ca/Twitter client.

It's a shell script that, besides usual UNIX utilities
(like sed/awk/grep), depends on xmlstarlet.[1]

It does its job (read/post notices from the command line)
in a simple manner. No fancy features.

It has been tested with bash (used by default) and ksh93,
on NetBSD.

This is how it looks like:

remove this dependency, as there's no really much need
for it. However, as I'm lazy and have xmlstarlet available,
it's not a priority.

P.S.: Consider the script "alpha".
